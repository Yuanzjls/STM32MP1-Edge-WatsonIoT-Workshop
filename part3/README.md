# Part 3

### Watson Studio Set up and Configuration in IBM Cloud

This section shows you how to deploy the Watson Studio service and how to create your first Jupyter Notebook.

- Instructions : [Watson Studio Set up and Configuration in IBM Cloud](STUDIO.md)

### Create training data

This section shows you how to create the training data needed to create a model so you will be able to determine what is happening from the sensor data.

- practical [Training Data](TRAINING.md)

### Jupyter Notebook Analytics - Create model

This section shows you how to use the training data to create a model that can then be used to classify actions.

- practical [Jupyter Notebook - STM32MP1](JUPYTER.md)

### Send and Run the model on the STM32MP1 Edge device

This section takes the output from the Jupyter Notebook and implements the trained model on the STM32MP1 Edge device.

- practical [Implement model on STM32MP1](MODEL.md)

## Workshop summary
