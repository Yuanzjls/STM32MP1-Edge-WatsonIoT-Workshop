# Workshop Summary

You have now completed the workshop.  I hope you enjoyed working through the various sections building up to the final solution.

Hopefully you now have a good understanding of some of the work needed to create an IoT / Edge solution.  In this workshop you:

### Part 1

- Learned about the [STM32MP1 Discovery Kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html) development board
- Explored OpenSTLinux on the STM32MP1
- Ran the Environmental Sensor programs to observe temperature, humidity, acceleration and gyroscope information
- Connected your browser to Node-RED running on the STM32MP1 OpenSTLinux
- Sent STM32MP1 Discovery Kit data to [Watson IoT Quickstart](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/)

### Part 2

- Created a Node-RED Starter Kit application connected to a Watson IoT Platform instance running in IBM Cloud
- Explored the Watson IoT Platform so that you can send/receive data from the STM32MP1 device
- Created a STM32MP1 device type and device
- Configured and secured the Node-RED visual programming editor
- Created a Node-RED flow and configured IoT Nodes
- Plotted the ST Microelectronics STM32MP1 temperature and humidity real time sensor data
- Triggered alerts when the real-time sensor data exceeds a threshold value
- Stored sensor data in a Cloudant database
- Create a chart of historical sensor data

### Part 3
- Set up a new Watson Studio Project with a Jupyter Notebook
- Generated and inspected the training data in Watson Studio
- Trained a classifier model in Watson Studio using data from the STM32MP1
- Validated the classifier model in Watson Studio
- Used Node-RED in the cloud to deploy the model coefficients to Node-RED on the edge
- Node-RED on the edge implemented the model to provide real-time classification of IoT data

This is just a taster of the many skills needed to implement an Edge / AI model solution.
